## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## This document reads data of LNs read by two readers and calculates cohen's kappa. The data goes into a contigency matrix and the kappa will be dichotomised over 4 levels of suspicious LNs.

```{r, echo=false}
library("vcd", "vcdExtra")
#pt3, 3T
suspiciousLNs <- as.table(
  rbind(
    c(0,0,0,0,0),
    c(0,0,1,0,0),
    c(0,1,0,1,0),
    c(0,2,2,1,1),
    c(0,0,2,1,6)
  )
)
dimnames(suspiciousLNs) <- list(
  RA = c("LoS1","LoS2","LoS3","LoS4","LoS5"),
  RT = c("LoS1","LoS2","LoS3","LoS4","LoS5")
)

suspiciousLNs

result.k <- Kappa(suspiciousLNs, weights = "Fleiss-Cohen")

confint(result.k)

summary(result.k)
# ASE = Asymptotic Standard Error

```

```{r, echo=false}
# Read confusion matrix from txt file
CM_FILE <- choose.files(default = "*.txt",
            caption = "Select just one csv file",
            multi = FALSE)
#filters = Filters[c("csv", "txt"),]) don't work (JvA)

cm <- read.table(CM_FILE, 
                header = FALSE,  
                sep = "\t")
                #dec = ",")
                #fill = TRUE, 
                #strip.white = TRUE, 
                #stringsAsFactors=TRUE)

require(data.table)
setDT(cm)

rbind(cm)

dimnames(cm) <- list(
  RA = c("LoS1","LoS2","LoS3","LoS4","LoS5"),
  RT = c("LoS1","LoS2","LoS3","LoS4","LoS5")
)

# Print cm
print(cm)

```

```{r, echo=false}
# Cannot yet convert read text file into a valid R table format...
# So, inserted the confusion matrix for all patients by hand;
# 3 Tesla LNs:
library("vcd", "vcdExtra")
cm <- as.table(
  rbind(
    c(0,0,0,0,0),
    c(1,1,3,13,0),
    c(0,1,6,18,6),
    c(0,0,10,10,11),
    c(0,0,1,4,13)
  )
)

# Cannot yet convert read text file into a valid R table format...
# So, inserted the confusion matrix for all patients by hand;
# 7 Tesla LNs:
library("vcd", "vcdExtra")
cm <- as.table(
  rbind(
    c(1,0,1,0,0),
    c(0,2,0,0,0),
    c(0,22,9,9,1),
    c(0,15,13,22,25),
    c(0,2,2,10,25)
  )
)

dimnames(cm) <- list(
  RA = c("LoS1","LoS2","LoS3","LoS4","LoS5"),
  RT = c("LoS1","LoS2","LoS3","LoS4","LoS5")
)

# Inspect data types and plot
str(cm); cm

all3or7TLNs <- cm

result.k <- Kappa(all3or7TLNs, weights = "Fleiss-Cohen")

confint(result.k)

summary(result.k)
# ASE = Asymptotic Standard Error

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
