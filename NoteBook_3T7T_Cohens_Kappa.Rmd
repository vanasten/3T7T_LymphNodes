## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## This document reads data of LNs read by two readers and calculates cohen's kappa. The data goes into a contigency matrix and the kappa will be dichotomised over 4 levels of suspicious LNs.

```{r, echo=false}

library("vcd", "vcdExtra")
suspiciousLNs <- as.table(
  rbind(
    c(0,0,0,0,0),
    c(0,0,1,0,0),
    c(0,1,0,1,0),
    c(0,2,2,1,1),
    c(0,0,2,1,6)
  )
)

dimnames(suspiciousLNs) <- list(
  RA = c("LoS1","LoS2","LoS3","LoS4","LoS5"),
  RT = c("LoS1","LoS2","LoS3","LoS4","LoS5")
)

suspiciousLNs

result.k <- Kappa(suspiciousLNs, weights = "Fleiss-Cohen")

summary(result.k)
# ASE = Asymptotic Standard Error

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
