## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## This document reads data of LNs read by two readers and calculates cohen's kappa. The data goes into a contigency matrix and the kappa will be dichotomised over 4 levels of suspicious LNs.

```{r, echo=false}
library("vcd", "vcdExtra")
#pt3, 3T
suspiciousLNs <- as.table(
  rbind(
    c(0,0,0,0,0),
    c(0,0,1,0,0),
    c(0,1,0,1,0),
    c(0,2,2,1,1),
    c(0,0,2,1,6)
  )
)
dimnames(suspiciousLNs) <- list(
  RA = c("LoS1","LoS2","LoS3","LoS4","LoS5"),
  RT = c("LoS1","LoS2","LoS3","LoS4","LoS5")
)

# https://datanovia.com/en/lessons/inter-rater-agreement-chart-in-r/
#Black square: exact observed agreement
#Gray square: partial agreement by including a weighted contribution 
#from off-diagonal cells. By default, the weight w = 1 is assigned to #all diagonal cells (exact agreement);
#a quadratic weight (1 - 1/(k - 1)^2) is assigned to the one-step
#disagreements (or to the one-step off-diagnal cells,
#partial agreement). If you donâ€™t want to show partial agreement,
#specify the argument weights as follow:
#agreementplot(anxiety, weights = 1)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
